Assignment 1.1 

What is Recycling of elements in a vector?
When applying an operation to two vectors that requires them to be the same length, R automatically recycles, or repeats, the shorter one, until it is long enough to match the longer one

• Prescriptive Analytics used to predict the future outcomes?  True 
• Base R packages installed automatically? True 

Give an example of recycling of elements.

If we have two Vectors c(1,2,4) , c(6,0,9,10,13), if the first one is shorter with only 3 elements. Now if we add these two, we will get a warning message as follows.
> c(1,2,4) + c(6,0,9,10,13)
[1]  7  2 13 11 15
Warning message:
In c(1, 2, 4) + c(6, 0, 9, 10, 13) :  longer object length is not a multiple of shorter object length
